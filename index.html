				<p class="text__info">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame
					of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
					They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our
					social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

					If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought
					in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial
					well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest
					them into a physical reality?

					We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a
					mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought
					is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.

					Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity
					into your life:

					Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express
					heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
					blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not
					lack.

					Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such
					as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed.
					Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to
					naturally believe them.

					Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
					achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way
					affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these
					subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you
					will become so.

					Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your
					affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can
					earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence
					needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more
					likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go
					hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.

					Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you
					can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and
					attract more money.

					Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend
					more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack.
					Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

					Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over
					time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this
					power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

				<p class="text__info">Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big
					‘R’
					of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.

					Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to
					the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they reach the
					far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in
					conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during their path.
					Which type of person would you like to model your business after?

					Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not.
					If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors, that will not
					last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that when
					they require your products or services, you are the go-to people.

					Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it there is
					a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a good way
					to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I
					had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over
					again on the radio or television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it
					out of your head. Although this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the
					recognition factor is quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are
					broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your
					potential customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your
					customers.

					There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target market
					demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by them.

					Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my
					competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a
					flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately
					being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes, “don’t put all your
					eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the
					affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full year of your advertising budget. An
					expensive radio or television promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what
					about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I
					haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.

					Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest
					and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming down dramatically new
					options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable,
					and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb
					appeal of full color and motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you,
					this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required
					if you want to get people “in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new
					e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at
					it, but if you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.</p>
